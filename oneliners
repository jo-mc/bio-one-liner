awk '{ if (($1 ~ /^>/) && ( NR > 1 )) { exit } print $0 }' hap1.fa | less -S

Get the first region from a fasta file.
  ($1 ~ /^>/) If the first field begins with '>'
  NR > 1      if the current line read fomr the file is greater than 1
  exit        This will exit at the start of the second region 
  print $0    Print the first line, and subsequent lines if they do not begin with '>'
  hap1.fa     The file we are looking at.
  | less -S   Pipe results to less, -S option prevents word wrap and allows horizontal scrolling with arrow keys.
              Alternately redirect output(the first region) to file with "> hap1_region1.fa"
 


Split fasta:

output each with 1.fa, 2.fa 3.fa etc...
awk '/^>/{s=++d".fa"} {print > s}' multi.fa   ( re: https://awesomeopensource.com/project/crazyhottommy/bioinformatics-one-liners )

Make it more useful: 
awk '/^>/{s=++d".fa"; fname = substr($1,2,length($1)); n = index(fname,"GL");   if (n == 0) {print fname "-" $2 ".fa";} } ' hs37d5.fa
awk '/^>/{s=++d".fa"; fname = substr($1,2,length($1)); n = index(fname,"GL");   if ($1 !~ /GL|NC/) {print fname "-" $2 ".fa";} } ' hs37d5.fa

FINAL:
Split a genome into a file for each of its chromosomes, or filter for chromosomes requried.

First test that the generated filenames will be suitable and unique, and filtered are as you require: (adjust $1 $2 $3 etc and specify filter for 
 chromosomes not required eg: 'GL' 'NC' [add another with '|MT' ] ) 
 
awk '/^>/{fname = substr($1,2,length($1)) "-" $2 ".fa"; if ($1 !~ /GL|NC/) {faOut = 1} else {faOut = 0} if (faOut == 1) print fname }' hs37d5.fa


Now update this command to output chromosomes requried to the filenames, based on your filename requirements, and this will create the output file 
for each chromosome:

awk '/^>/{fname = substr($1,2,length($1)) "-" $2 ".fa"; if ($1 !~ /GL|NC/) {faOut = 1} else {faOut = 0} } {if (faOut == 1) {print > fname} }' hs37d5.fa

hs37d5.fa : the  genome name.

$1 $2 $3 ... are the space delimited column data from the current line.  AWK process line by line and extract fields to $1, $2 etc. Special case $0 is 
  the whole line (all fields)
  
This part : {fname = substr($1,2,length($1)) "-" $2 ".fa"; if ($1 !~ /GL|NC/) {faOut = 1} else {faOut = 0} }  will only be processed if the  
 current line for the genome begins with ">"
 
fname => create a filename from the chromosome line data in the fasta file, (the substr functions removes the ">" from the start of the first field) 
  build you filename based on the data in your chromosome /region  identifier, ie $3 could be a better filename, make sure it is unique, otherwise
   you will write over previous output.
 
the first 'if' will not print any chromosome where the first field contians  a GL or a NC  (substitute for your chromosome/region not required)
 
The final if will print to fname if faOut is set to 1. ( here the '>' is a redirect to file not a greater than)
